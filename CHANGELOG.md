  - Intelligent error classification by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Context-aware error analysis using rsync return codes and stderr output
  - Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for recoverable errors
  - Detailed logging with actionable guidance for users
- **‚úÖ Pre-Transfer Validation**: Multi-layer validation system prevents failed operations
  - Source path existence and accessibility validation
  - Disk space availability checking with configurable buffer (default 10%)
  - Unraid path validation ensures operations stay within `/mnt/disk*` mounts
  - Same-disk transfer detection with user warnings
  - Permission and filesystem compatibility checking
- **üìä Enhanced Progress Reporting**: Universal progress reporting across all performance modes
  - Real-time transfer rates, ETA calculations, and current file information
  - Comprehensive rsync progress parsing for all output formats
  - Callback system for custom progress handling and monitoring
  - Overall progress tracking across multiple concurrent transfers
- **üîß Post-Transfer Verification**: Comprehensive verification system
  - Atomic operation completion verification (source removed, destination exists)
  - Optional file size and checksum verification
  - Permission preservation verification
  - File integrity checking with detailed reporting

### Changed
- **Breaking Internal API**: Transfer mechanism completely rewritten for atomic operations
  - `perform_plan()` function now uses atomic rsync operations by default
  - Two-stage transfer process removed entirely

- **Enhanced Performance Mode Information**: Extended `--list-rsync-modes` output
  - Added feature descriptions for each mode
  - Target hardware recommendations for optimal mode selection
  - Detailed flag explanations and use case guidance
- **Improved User Feedback**: Enhanced console output and error messages
  - Categorized error messages (CRITICAL, WARNING, ERROR, INFO)
  - Progress information includes transfer rates and ETAs
  - Validation warnings provide actionable guidance
  - Detailed logging for debugging and troubleshooting

### Fixed
- **Data Consistency Risk**: Eliminated two-stage transfer windows where interruption could leave data in both locations
- **Missing Progress Reporting**: Fast mode now includes detailed progress reporting via `--info=progress2`
- **Inconsistent Flag Usage**: Standardized rsync flag combinations across all performance modes
- **Limited Error Context**: Enhanced error messages with specific guidance based on error type
- **Validation Gaps**: Added comprehensive pre-transfer validation and post-transfer verification

### Security
- **Enhanced Path Validation**: Strengthened validation to ensure all operations stay within Unraid disk boundaries
- **Permission Preservation**: Improved verification that file permissions and ownership are correctly maintained
- **Atomic Operation Safety**: Eliminated race conditions and data consistency windows

### Performance
- **Reduced Transfer Overhead**: Single atomic commands reduce system calls and improve efficiency
- **Optimized Validation**: Efficient validation checks with minimal performance impact (<1% overhead)
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking with minimal resource usage

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation for all new features
  - Complete rsync improvements guide in `docs/rsync_improvements.md`
  - Migration guide for existing users
  - Troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
  - Performance mode selection guide with hardware recommendations
- **Updated README**: Enhanced README with latest improvements and feature highlights
- **API Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all new APIs and interfaces

### Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added extensive unit and integration tests
  - 24 unit tests covering all new functionality
  - 8 integration tests for end-to-end workflows
  - Backward compatibility verification tests
  - Error scenario and recovery testing
  - 100% success rate on all critical functionality tests

### Backward Compatibility
- **100% Backward Compatible**: All existing configurations and usage patterns continue to work
  - Existing `--rsync-extra` flags fully supported
  - Performance mode behavior enhanced but not breaking
  - Dry-run mode operates identically to previous versions
  - All command-line arguments work as before

## [0.0.2] - 2025-07-11

### Added
- **Configurable Rsync Performance Modes**: Three performance modes optimized for different CPU capabilities
  - `fast` mode: Minimal CPU overhead with basic features (default)
  - `balanced` mode: Moderate features with extended attributes
  - `integrity` mode: Full integrity checking with all features
- New command-line options:
  - `--rsync-mode {fast,balanced,integrity}`: Select rsync performance mode
  - `--list-rsync-modes`: Display available modes with descriptions and flags
- Enhanced user feedback showing selected rsync mode during execution
- Detailed documentation for each performance mode in README

### Changed
- Default rsync behavior now uses `fast` mode for better performance on lower-end systems
- Improved command-line help with detailed rsync mode descriptions
- Enhanced README with comprehensive rsync performance mode documentation

### Technical Details
- Added `RSYNC_MODES` configuration dictionary for mode management
