## [0.0.2] - 2025-07-11

### Added
- **Configurable Rsync Performance Modes**: Three performance modes optimized for different CPU capabilities
  - `fast` mode: Minimal CPU overhead with basic features (default)
  - `balanced` mode: Moderate features with extended attributes
  - `integrity` mode: Full integrity checking with all features
- New command-line options:
  - `--rsync-mode {fast,balanced,integrity}`: Select rsync performance mode
  - `--list-rsync-modes`: Display available modes with descriptions and flags
- Enhanced user feedback showing selected rsync mode during execution
- Detailed documentation for each performance mode in README

### Changed
- Default rsync behavior now uses `fast` mode for better performance on lower-end systems
- Improved command-line help with detailed rsync mode descriptions
- Enhanced README with comprehensive rsync performance mode documentation

### Technical Details
- Added `RSYNC_MODES` configuration dictionary for mode management
- Implemented `get_rsync_flags()` function for mode validation
- Updated `perform_plan()` function to accept rsync_mode parameter
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing rsync-extra options

## [0.0.1] - 2025-07-11

### Added
- Initial release of Unraid Rebalancer
- Intelligent disk rebalancing with configurable target percentages
- Dry-run mode by default for safety
- Support for saving and loading redistribution plans as JSON
- Comprehensive filtering options (disks, shares, globs)
- Configurable allocation unit depth
- Progress tracking and detailed logging
- Rsync-based transfers with resume support
- Safety margins and error handling
- Verbose logging and log file support
- Command-line interface with extensive options

### Features
- **Safe Operations**: Dry-run by default, only moves data when `--execute` is specified
- **Flexible Targeting**: Target specific fill percentages or auto-balance with headroom
- **Plan Management**: Save plans as JSON for later execution or review
- **Granular Control**: Configure allocation units at different directory depths
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Include/exclude specific disks, shares, and file patterns
- **Resume Support**: Uses rsync with partial transfer support for interrupted operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting during operations
- **Logging**: Configurable logging with file output support

### Technical Details
- Python 3.8+ compatibility
- Uses only standard library modules (no external dependencies)
- Preserves file attributes, permissions, and hardlinks
- Avoids Unraid user share copy bug by using `/mnt/disk*` paths only
- Implements greedy algorithm for optimal redistribution planning
- 1GiB safety margin on destination disks
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Safety Features
- Multiple pre-flight checks
- Atomic operations using rsync
- Space validation before transfers
- Detailed plan preview before execution
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful handling of interruptions
