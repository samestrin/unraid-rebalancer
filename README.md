## How It Works

1. **Discovery**: Scans `/mnt/disk*` mounts to identify available disks and their usage
2. **Analysis**: Builds allocation units based on configured depth and filters
3. **Planning**: Creates an optimal redistribution plan using a greedy algorithm
4. **Execution**: Uses rsync to safely move data between disks
5. **Cleanup**: Removes source files after successful transfers

### Allocation Units

The tool works with "allocation units" - directories or files that are moved as a whole:

- **Depth 0**: Entire share content on a disk
- **Depth 1**: Direct children of share root (default)
- **Depth 2+**: Deeper directory levels

### Rsync Performance Modes

The tool offers three rsync performance modes to optimize transfers based on your CPU capabilities:

- **fast** (default): Minimal CPU overhead with basic features
  - Flags: `-av --partial --inplace --numeric-ids --no-compress`
  - Best for: Lower-end CPUs, maximum transfer speed
  - Trade-offs: No hard link preservation, no extended attributes

- **balanced**: Moderate features with extended attributes
  - Flags: `-avPR -X --partial --inplace --numeric-ids`
  - Best for: Mid-range CPUs, balanced performance
  - Trade-offs: Some CPU overhead for extended attribute preservation

- **integrity**: Full integrity checking with all features
  - Flags: `-aHAX --info=progress2 --partial --inplace --numeric-ids`
  - Best for: High-end CPUs, maximum data integrity
  - Trade-offs: Higher CPU usage, progress reporting overhead

Use `--list-rsync-modes` to see detailed information about each mode.

## Performance Metrics & Monitoring

The Unraid Rebalancer includes comprehensive performance monitoring and reporting capabilities to help you optimize your rebalancing operations and track system performance over time.

### Real-Time Monitoring

When enabled with `--metrics` or `--show-progress`, the tool provides:

- **Transfer Speeds**: Real-time MB/s rates for each file transfer
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion percentage and estimated time remaining
- **System Resources**: CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O rates
- **Performance Alerts**: Warnings for slow transfers or high resource usage

### Historical Analysis

Track performance trends over time:

```bash
# View all historical operations
sudo ./unraid_rebalancer.py --show-history

# Compare recent operations and get optimization recommendations
sudo ./unraid_rebalancer.py --compare-runs

# View detailed summary of latest operation
sudo ./unraid_rebalancer.py --metrics-summary
```

### Report Generation

Generate comprehensive reports in multiple formats:

- **Text Reports**: Human-readable summaries with performance statistics
- **JSON Export**: Machine-readable data for integration with other tools
- **CSV Export**: Spreadsheet-compatible format for detailed analysis
- **ASCII Charts**: Visual performance graphs displayed in terminal

### Performance Recommendations

The tool automatically analyzes your historical data and provides actionable recommendations:

- Optimal rsync mode selection based on your system's performance
- Identification of performance bottlenecks and slowdowns
- Suggestions for improving transfer efficiency
- Alerts about recurring transfer failures

### Metrics Data Structure

Collected metrics include:

- **Operation-level**: Duration, total files, success rates, overall transfer rates
- **Transfer-level**: Individual file transfer times, speeds, and error details
- **System-level**: CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage over time
- **Error tracking**: Detailed failure logs and error categorization

## Safety Features

- **Dry-run by default**: No data is moved unless `--execute` is specified
- **Pre-flight checks**: Validates disk mounts and available space
- **Atomic operations**: Uses rsync for reliable, resumable transfers
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error checking and logging
- **Space margins**: Maintains 1GiB safety margin on destination disks
- **Plan preview**: Shows detailed plan before execution

## Best Practices

### Before Running

1. **Stop heavy writers**: Pause downloads, backups, and other disk-intensive operations
2. **Run from console**: Use SSH with screen/tmux, avoid web terminal
3. **Review the plan**: Always examine the dry-run output first
4. **Backup critical data**: Ensure you have recent backups
5. **Check disk health**: Verify all disks are healthy before rebalancing

### During Operation

1. **Monitor progress**: Watch for errors or unusual behavior
2. **Don't interrupt**: Let operations complete naturally
3. **Check logs**: Review log output for warnings or errors

### After Completion

1. **Verify results**: Check that files moved correctly
2. **Update shares**: Refresh user shares if needed
3. **Monitor performance**: Ensure balanced access patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No /mnt/disk* data disks found"**
- Ensure you're running on an Unraid system
- Check that data disks are mounted
- Verify disk naming follows Unraid conventions

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Run with `sudo` for proper disk access
- Check file permissions on source directories

**Rsync failures**
- Check available disk space
- Verify destination disk is writable
- Review rsync error messages in logs

**Plan shows no moves**
- Disks may already be balanced
- Try adjusting `--target-percent` or `--min-unit-size`
- Check if filters are excluding too much data

### Getting Help

1. Run with `--verbose` for detailed logging
2. Check the log file for specific error messages
3. Verify your command-line options
4. Test with a small subset using `--include-disks`
